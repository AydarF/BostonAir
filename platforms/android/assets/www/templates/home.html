              <p class="animated fadeInDown">Boston (pronounced /ˈbɒstən/) is a city that really feels like a town full of business people during the day and college kids at night. We're loyal to our teams and will kick your ass or yell at you if you don't love them too. We'll do this either sober or drunken. Most times it's better drunken though. Basically it's really funny to us.</p>
              <!-- <p>Another thing: You only call it Beantown if you're not from here, and if you're getting a ride on a duck boat, don't quack at us. It's wicked anoying. Would you want to be quacked at every day? I don't think so. It's cold here due to the fact that Boston is a freaking wind tunnel so we're already pissed off.
